# Emant300DL
 [This project is supposed to be archive since 2012] data logger windows form for microcontroller [Emant300](http://emant.com/251004.page)
## Propose
There is an ancient microcontroller before Arduino namely, Emant300. It is used by chemist for collecting data of the chemistry reaction (well, I don't know about chemistry stuff). Apart from its behindhand, the microcontroller promised high sampling rate and high resolution of data (it still seem better than arduino nowaday). Although it is popular with Labview, the vender also release .NET library for developper. I thus made this data logger windows form from Basic .NET. 
## To use it
Clone this repository then seek for [emanttest.exe](./emanttest/bin/Debug/).
